  <h1>About me... in <p2>IT</p2></h1>  
<p>I am a striving IT software developer. CodeNation has welcomed me on a 3 week beginners “Develop : Coding” course where I will get a gist of what coding is all about and how it all works. One could not be happier, right? Wrong! A 3 month ”Master: Coding” bootcamp course is what I am interested in and as far as I was exposed to Xcode and JavaScipt I love the fact that YOU choose the way you code a program. Being creative and choosing the way you solve problems with JS is a great way to work with full flexibility.

Enough of my expectations, let’s move on to my personal life. I’m a 29 year old with experience in the leisure industry (Lifeguard, Personal Trainer, Operations Manager), Consulting (Wroclaw Branch Manager), IT(HP Customer Response Center) and Translations (Polish-English). I’ve been living in Poland, Germany, Holland, South Africa and UK (for the past 4 years), gaining experience and exposure to different cultures I’ve gained a creative hand in solving problems/issues. Recently I have moved from London to Manchester to bring some freshness into my life, let’s hope it was worth it!
