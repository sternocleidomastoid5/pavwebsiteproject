    <h1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
        </h1>
        <p>Let me begin with the core of creating the website, which is Visual Studio Code. I cannot express how it is well designed and transparent with the coding options and the brilliant use of colour for each code line. I can place a bet that 20 years ago it took at least 20 times longer to create the same website using the tools back then. In addition you can save your progress from VS Code in a repository on On GitHub - which is a great addition to the program itself. That being out of the way, I have been recently introduced to Trello and personally I think it is a fantastic app for people who don’t know where to start their work and have no strategy. You set up the tasks you need to do and then tick them off by moving them from one side of the board to another, which gives you a sense of accomplishment.
                Slack was also useful for sharing interesting website links with peers. Honorable mention to Google Drive and easy access to Microsoft Word-like documents where you can type all your data out with a spell-check option!
