<h2>Outcome 1</h2>
<h1>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h1>
<p>My website was designed to be simple and to the point. It describes various aspects such as the creation of a website and encountered problems. The index page consists of “About Me” page with 4 tab bars at the very top (Home, Unit 1, Unit 2, Contact) and a little surprise when you click on “Le Pav” at the bottom of the page! Clicking into each section will take you through the website with the possibility to go back to the home page. It’s design is very simple - click on one of the tab bars to direct you to a different page with Unit 1&2 questions and answers and their outcomes. You encounter the Q&A by just scrolling down the page. Different fonts and and colours were used to distinguish what the text is about. The theme used here is taken from the movie “IT”, which perfectly fits in with the fonts and colours.</p>

<h1>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h1>
<p>Not until a few years back we had a very important law come in to life that restricted using one’s personal data (GDPR), no matter if it was a piece of art or composed music making it harder for websites to have mainstream content - unless you paid a fair price. Now, if I was to publish online my current website I would be probably sued for copyrights or my website would be taken down as I have used a poster from the movie “IT” as my background image and I have not asked for permission (shame on me!). You could go around that simply by using copyright free images or music that are both widely available but just don’t stand out on a person's website. Another constraint could be the content applied on the website. Adult images would significantly affect entering that website as you have a choice to enter (+18). Furthermore, if someone has a blog and copies a certain extent of someone else's work, that person could be accused of plagiarism if no references were added.</p>
<br>
<h1>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h1>
<p>At a later stage of completing my project I have realised that some people may have difficulties whilst trying to access the website. Let’s start off with the fact that upon entering there is no warning that some images might be used as scary or inappropriate. Another issue is that the site has not been tested on mobile phones, so there is a risk factor there - will it work the same on android and iOS? Furthermore, dyslexic people might have an issue reading the text - I could introduce a magnifying glass here or make the text bigger and more presentable. </p>
<br>
<h1>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites </h1>
<p>The two most paramount file types where a decent website would not be possible is: HTML and CSS. The first one gives us the basic functions, structure and text used in our website. The latter, provides us with all the visual content and the overall design with quirky features of our choice. Other popular files for images are: JPG (most common image file), PNG (another less popular image file), GIF (looped video), TIF (highest quality image file), PSD (image from Photoshop), AVI (audio/video file), DOC (Microsoft Word document), MPEG (Motion Picture), PDF (Portable Document Format).</p>
<h2>Outcome 3</h2>
<h1>3.1 Test your site appropriately to make sure it works on different browsers and that everything works as planned</h1>
