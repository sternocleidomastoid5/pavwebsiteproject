    <h1>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects â€“ How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h1>
    <p>Let us start of with what is GDPR? It is short for General Data Protection Regulation and as the name suggests, its main goal is to increase the safety of our personal data. GDPR will have impact on digital marketing in three main aspects: data access, data processing and consent. For instance, within a completed project, everything should be clear to the individual who will be processing their data and that includes any third-parties involved. In that aspect the individual should get as much detail as possible where the data is going to be used and what for. A great option would be to let the individuals withdraw their data if they feel they need to without any consequences. Another feature of GDPR is that within online websites or mobile applications, customers will not have pre-ticked boxes, so they can read all about rules and regulations beforehand. This shows how legal and safe we have become when doing digital projects. On the contrary, it limits what we can include in these projects. [7]
