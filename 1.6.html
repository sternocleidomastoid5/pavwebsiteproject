    <h1>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control </h1>
    <p>Let’s start off with the fact that without these technologies creating projects would be very hard if not impossible. Trello has helped with the tasks and keeping track of what has been done and what needs doing. Very clear, easy to use app. Next we have got GitHub which is a website that stores all our codes and saved any updates/changes made to that particular code made in VS Code. Speaking of Visual Studio Code, the program lets us programme in what is called the “Triad of cornerstone technologies for the web” - HTML, CSS and JS. Up next we have Slack, which is an app that helps communicate between the people involved in the project - from sending website links to asking for information. Google Drive is really useful when it comes to file sharing and writing texts. With it we can also work on one project from multiple computers and it will show results in real-time! There are thousands of great technologies out there that are useful in one way or another.</p>
