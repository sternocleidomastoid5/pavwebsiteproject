    <h1>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software â€“ how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h1>
<p>Choosing the right software for your job can be a lot of research beforehand, hence you should focus on the pain points. Technology is a tool that help do things efficiently, better and faster. The key of choosing the right technology is to see what are the strong points of the job and what could you do better. You also need to consider the financial aspects (native vs cross platform applications) and on how many platforms we need the software on. Once those things have been considered, we choose the software/IT system. To list some software that I have used, I would start with Trello - great website to store and keeps things planned and in order. Visual Studio Code is paramount for coding JS/HTML/CSS as it is very transparent and easy to use. [6]</p>
