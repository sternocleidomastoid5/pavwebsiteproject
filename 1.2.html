    <h1>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful?</h1>
    <p1>There are a few factors that determine if a digital project will be successful. Let’s start with the fact that you need smart people. Without the right team in place, any strategy can fall apart. Second factor is smart planning. It is important to assign people to their tasks and make sure everyone is the team is involved in the project. A great tool for assigning tasks is Trello. Using the Kanban method everyone in your team will know what to do. Open communication is also advised, as it bonds the team and regular stand-up meetings show progress of the project. Communication is the best way to prevent problems from occurring. Next factor is risk management. Team leaders know that projects rarely go off exactly as planned, that’s why it is good practice to have a risk assessment as a backup plan. The last factor to consider is strong project closure. If not planned correctly it will have the potential to continue to consume resources. The project should be properly delivered and tested before releasing. 
            There are a number of tools that help make a digital project successful. We have mentioned Trello before for organising tasks. PowerPoint for presentations, Slack (or any other messaging app) for communication purposes, Google Drive for document access. [3]
