    <h1>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? </h1>
    <p1>When planning your website you have to consider a few factors, like what will be the goal of the website, organizing my content list of what is going to be present, setting a timeline of how long I am going to spend creating the website, asking friends to test out the functionality and user experience, how do you want it to look, what themes are going to be present and the layout of the screen and the navigation structure. All of this can be put on and seen in the link to my Trello board. I have included things like font size and colour, clicking options and may introduce a “Switch to another language” tab bar. [4]
