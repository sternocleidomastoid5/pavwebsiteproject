<h1>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h1>
    <p>In the XXI century IT has an paramount impact on a functioning company, no matter if it’s big or small. Information Technology affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. Speaking of relationships, communication with customers is key and that's where IT is essential. Easy and transparent relations with clients, bonds and creates a stronger public image with benefits for both. Technology saves valuable resources, such as time and physical space. Modern offices don’t store rows and rows of file cabinets - instead they store their data on a digital server, making information easy to find and less space to use up. With data kept on servers information management is crucial, that’s why the workflow is based on tracking sales, managing expenses, monitoring activity - everything in one place. <a href="https://www.broadviewnet.com/blog/2015/09/the-important-role-of-it-in-modern-business/" target="_blank"><p3>[1]</p3></a> With proper efficient operations in place, a company could save storage costs of holding a product and money by holding meetings via the internet instead of corporate headquarters or even communication wise between factory managers and shipment coordinators. In conclusion IT in a modern business has become very important as it simplifies daily work, boost up productivity, performance and customer relations. <a href="https://www.oksbdc.org/why-is-technology-important-in-business/" target="_blank"><p3>[2]</p3></a></p>

<h1>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful?</h1>
    <p>There are a few factors that determine if a digital project will be successful. Let’s start with the fact that you need smart people. Without the right team in place, any strategy can fall apart. Second factor is smart planning. It is important to assign people to their tasks and make sure everyone is the team is involved in the project. A great tool for assigning tasks is Trello. Using the Kanban method everyone in your team will know what to do. Open communication is also advised, as it bonds the team and regular stand-up meetings show progress of the project. Communication is the best way to prevent problems from occurring. Next factor is risk management. Team leaders know that projects rarely go off exactly as planned, that’s why it is good practice to have a risk assessment as a backup plan. The last factor to consider is strong project closure. If not planned correctly it will have the potential to continue to consume resources. The project should be properly delivered and tested before releasing. 
    There are a number of tools that help make a digital project successful. We have mentioned Trello before for organising tasks. PowerPoint for presentations, Slack (or any other messaging app) for communication purposes, Google Drive for document access. <a href="https://project-management.com/five-factors-that-lead-to-successful-projects/" target="_blank"><p3>[3]</p3></a></p>
    <br>
<h1>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h1>
    <p>When planning your website you have to consider a few factors, like what will be the goal of the website, organizing my content list of what is going to be present, setting a timeline of how long I am going to spend creating the website, asking friends to test out the functionality and user experience, how do you want it to look, what themes are going to be present and the layout of the screen and the navigation structure. All of this can be put on and seen in the link to my Trello board. I have included things like font size and colour, clicking options and may introduce a “Switch to another language” tab bar. <a href="https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/develop-a-project-plan-for-your-website/" target="_blank"><p3>[4]</p3></a></p>

    <br>
<h1>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?</h1>
    <p>In the past few years the success rate of a digital/IT project was below 60%. That gives us realistically a 50/50 chance that a project will help the company. Taking these figures into consideration we need to look closely why projects are bound to fail. Let’s start with misalignment with business processes. When undergoing a project the team needs to focus not only on the user experience, but the functionality and what the project is all about. On the contrary, some projects are made with an over ambition instead of making things simple and working. A perfect website made within a few months without a real business plan is a path to failure. When creating a digital project we need to consider agile, iterative processes that will be available to tweak the project, as a fixed plan for the next few years will just not work. You should be able to adjust the project in order to reflect business changes within the company at any given moment. <a href="http://blog.celerity.com/5-reasons-digital-projects-fail-the-forgotten-role-of-business-process" target="_blank"><p3>[5]</p3></a></p>
    <br>
<h1>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h1>
    <p>Choosing the right software for your job can be a lot of research beforehand, hence you should focus on the pain points. Technology is a tool that help do things efficiently, better and faster. The key of choosing the right technology is to see what are the strong points of the job and what could you do better. You also need to consider the financial aspects (native vs cross platform applications) and on how many platforms we need the software on. Once those things have been considered, we choose the software/IT system. To list some software that I have used, I would start with Trello - great website to store and keeps things planned and in order. Visual Studio Code is paramount for coding JS/HTML/CSS as it is very transparent and easy to use. <a href="https://www.inc.com/cox-business/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-for-your-small-business-or-startup.html" target="_blank"><p3>[6]</p3></a></p>
    <br>
<h1>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h1>
    <p>Let’s start off with the fact that without these technologies creating projects would be very hard if not impossible. Trello has helped with the tasks and keeping track of what has been done and what needs doing. Very clear, easy to use app. Next we have got GitHub which is a website that stores all our codes and saved any updates/changes made to that particular code made in VS Code. Speaking of Visual Studio Code, the program lets us programme in what is called the “Triad of cornerstone technologies for the web” - HTML, CSS and JS. Up next we have Slack, which is an app that helps communicate between the people involved in the project - from sending website links to asking for information. Google Drive is really useful when it comes to file sharing and writing texts. With it we can also work on one project from multiple computers and it will show results in real-time! There are thousands of great technologies out there that are useful in one way or another.</p>
    <br>
<h1>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h1>
    <p>Let us start of with what is GDPR? It is short for General Data Protection Regulation and as the name suggests, its main goal is to increase the safety of our personal data. GDPR will have impact on digital marketing in three main aspects: data access, data processing and consent. For instance, within a completed project, everything should be clear to the individual who will be processing their data and that includes any third-parties involved. In that aspect the individual should get as much detail as possible where the data is going to be used and what for. A great option would be to let the individuals withdraw their data if they feel they need to without any consequences. Another feature of GDPR is that within online websites or mobile applications, customers will not have pre-ticked boxes, so they can read all about rules and regulations beforehand. This shows how legal and safe we have become when doing digital projects. On the contrary, it limits what we can include in these projects. <a href="https://www.edelman.co.uk/insights/how-will-gdpr-impact-digital-marketing-professionals" target="_blank"><p3>[7]</p3></a></p>

<h2>Outcome 2</h2>
<br>
<h1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
    </h1>
    <p>Let me begin with the core of creating the website, which is Visual Studio Code. I cannot express how it is well designed and transparent with the coding options and the brilliant use of colour for each code line. I can place a bet that 20 years ago it took at least 20 times longer to create the same website using the tools back then. In addition you can save your progress from VS Code in a repository on On GitHub - which is a great addition to the program itself. That being out of the way, I have been recently introduced to Trello and personally I think it is a fantastic app for people who don’t know where to start their work and have no strategy. You set up the tasks you need to do and then tick them off by moving them from one side of the board to another, which gives you a sense of accomplishment.
            Slack was also useful for sharing interesting website links with peers. Honorable mention to Google Drive and easy access to Microsoft Word-like documents where you can type all your data out with a spell-check option!
    </p>
<h1>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h1>
<p>The IT tools that I was provided with were enough and beyond to create a website. The biggest one of the whole lot was Visual Studio Code, as I have never used it in the past and will definitely use it more often from now on. It’s a very powerful tool to create codes in languages such as JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. The whole brain of the app or website lies within this program, so I think it’s the most important tool I was asked to use. 
    Trello, as I’ve mentioned previously is a great app for the ones who don’t know how to start a project. It helped me organise my workflow and made me realise that I should create smaller doable tasks than be overwhelmed by the whole project and get stressed out.
    On the hardware side, I really enjoyed using a MacBook (as I have never previously owned or used one) and the fact that I used a laptop with an external monitor that made creating content really pleasurable and easy.
    </p>
<h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h1>
<p>I am happy with my final product, because of two good reasons - it’s simple and it works. Why over complicate things within a few days we have to create our own website, if it can be straightforward and every link you press works. Personally, I’m a fan of the movie/book “IT” written by Stephen King, so I made a clever connection between the industry we’re in and at movie (IT = I.T.). I even used a thematic font and colour schemes to up the game. So, we have established that it’s colourful, a bit scary and simple - these strong points can also become a weakness, because why not add more? When creating a website you look at different possibilities, or compare your website to others and think -”I want to implement that too!”. That means I could include a lot of flashy images, or a moving background. That is one of the weaknesses of my website. I could also include a clearer font for an easy read for everyone. I could also include a pre-index page that states “If you’re not 18 click X and if you’re over 18 click Y” and then make the website even more horrific!</p>
<br>
<h1>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h1>
<p>I could improve the website in various ways. Because it’s only my first ever website created within a few days I have not had a lot of experience, but one thing's sure - there is a multitude of possibilities to have the same website rearranged and made more professionally. The website could be more user friendly. A perfect example could be that I could assign a button for blind people to have the text read out to them. Another example is that, because the text is the opposite how we are accustomed to (white letters on a black background), I could include a magnifying glass (as the cursor) to help people read it. I could also make the website more “flashy”, where I’d include a multitude of spinning logos, moveable background and have a sense of an interactive experience - yes, to scare people even more! Even though this is a final product for this course, I will experiment and add features, playing around to make a website I would want to have published for someone.</p>
<br>
<h1>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h1>
<p>Based on how I have made my website, I have tried to make my pages error free. I achieved this by constantly refreshing my web page after any minor change in VS Studio, whether it would be in the CSS section or HTML5. This prevented me from searching for bugs, looking at each individual line and figuring out where the error was. It is also a prime example of how front-end development and back-end development differ. In front-end web design, if something goes wrong, you can actually physically see where, whereas in back-end it would be lines and lines of codes. In addition to this I have had issued with centering my text to be in the middle of the web page - it centered the text not the positioning. Here is where I got advice to put margins - it worked perfectly. The text was much more clearer to read and see and the headings despite not being centered, perfectly fit the site.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Outcome 3</h2>
<br>
<h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h1>
<p>Efficiency-wise, Trello was a helpful tool, but you always had to go back to the board and update it. So in terms of being focused on your work, you had to remember to update the board, which was not always the case. There is a possibility I could be more efficient having one more external screen (3 in total), as having VS Code on one, my website on the second and codepen website on the third one.
In my humble opinion I would prefer to do websites on my own, because I know how to plan out the design and functions, whereas if it was a team project everyone would have their own opinions about functions and the design part. That could lead up to the project not being well balanced. On the contrary, a team project could be more creative and implement interesting features, besides “Two heads are better than one”.
 </p>
 <br>
 <h1>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h1>
 <p>My personal answer to that is a two-factor route: get a good sleep and drink coffee. This makes my day a lot more productive rather than if I was half asleep and no morning caffeine intake, which boosts my brain. Another factor to consider is, in your spare time find the answers to your project online, then implement them at work instead of figuring out and testing a certain code/ability. Get to know the coding side too - it’s like speaking a foreign language - get to know some syntax and then implement and play around with sentences. Last tip would be - be active, not passive. If you don’t know how to solve a problem, ask a peer, or try finding it out yourself. Giving up will only make code learning worse.</p>
 <br>
 <h1>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h1>
 <p>Next time I have a project to make a website, I’d start of with the theme, functionality and gathering information I want to put on there - research. In this project we can’t have all the information before designing the website, because some of the questions were based upon finishing the project, so you have to go back and forth with HTML5 and CSS to finish the work. Not the ideal scenario, but it is doable. Another part which I would do differently is I would not spend so much time in preparing the written content as it was time consuming. Slack was useful, but not to the extent that I needed to use it all the time. If I was to do the project in a team, I’d distribute the workload to one team doing the HTML5 (content) and the other to do CSS (visual) part.</p>
 <br>
 <h1>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h1>
 <p>First of all I would test my website if everything functions how it was designed to. I would run the website through different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari) to see if there are no size ratio issues. Then, with my mentors (Liam) brilliant eyesight, I’d ask him to see it there are any mistakes, errors, bugs or features I should get rid of or implement in the website. I would also ask my colleagues and people who are in IT for some advice they would give me based on what they have seen. It is always good to know others perspective and what you don’t necessarily see might be actually an easy fix. After all the positive or negative information gathered from the people who've seen the website I would  make notes and changes to make the project as enjoyable as it can be.</p>
