    <h1>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? </h1>
    <p>In the past few years the success rate of a digital/IT project was below 60%. That gives us realistically a 50/50 chance that a project will help the company. Taking these figures into consideration we need to look closely why projects are bound to fail. Let’s start with misalignment with business processes. When undergoing a project the team needs to focus not only on the user experience, but the functionality and what the project is all about. On the contrary, some projects are made with an over ambition instead of making things simple and working. A perfect website made within a few months without a real business plan is a path to failure. When creating a digital project we need to consider agile, iterative processes that will be available to tweak the project, as a fixed plan for the next few years will just not work. You should be able to adjust the project in order to reflect business changes within the company at any given moment. [5]</p>
